# IIT-Typemaster-Game


It is my 1st semester project in IIT , JU. As a fresher and with little knowledge of C language I built this game along with my project mate. Its a word matching game , where a players typing accuracy and speed increases. A player will be given words on screen one by one and which will vanish within a short time , he/she has to type the word correctly to get the next word and any misspelling or wrong word will be loss of the game. The game is divided in few levels. There is a scope of lot of improvement in this game in future.
